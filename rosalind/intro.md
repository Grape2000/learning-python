my explanations for the exercise:

INT1
First I had to download python, then I launched IDLE. 
In the file I typed print("Hello, World!")
Next I was confused how to open a new window?? So I also wasnÂ´t able to save the file.
Then I downloaded the file and put >>>import this which gave me a long poetry called "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"
That I saved and submitted to Rosalind


INT2
I made stirngs for a and b with the given numbers of the dataset. (a = 890 and b = 863)
Then I entered a function for c = (a**2 + b**2)
Last I told python to print(c)
the answer is 1705169


INT3
I splitted it two times, once 23:31 and once 122:129 (I had to add +1 at the second number behind the : because otherwise the output would be missing the last letter)
then I printed both answers with a " " between
