my explanations for the exercise:

INT1
First I had to download python, then I launched IDLE. 
In the file I typed print("Hello, World!")
Next I was confused how to open a new window?? So I also wasn´t able to save the file.
Then I downloaded the file and put >>>import this which gave me a long poetry called "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"
That I saved and submitted to Rosalind


INT2
I don´t know I am lost


INT3
Sorry it´s to late, my brain is not braining anymore
