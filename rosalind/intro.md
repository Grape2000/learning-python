my explanations for the exercise:

INT1
First I had to download python, then I launched IDLE. 
In the file I typed print("Hello, World!")
Next I was confused how to open a new window?? So I also wasnÂ´t able to save the file.
Then I downloaded the file and put >>>import this which gave me a long poetry called "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"
That I saved and submitted to Rosalind


INT2
I made stirngs for a and b with the given numbers of the dataset. (a = 817 and b = 856)
Then I entered a function for c = (a**2 + b**2) **0.5
Last I told python to print(c)


INT3
I splitted it two times, once 22:28 and once 97:103 
then I printed both answers
