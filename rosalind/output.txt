Some things in life are bad, they can really make you mad
/nOther things just make you swear and curse
/nWhen you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle
/nThis will help things turn out for the best
/nAlways look on the bright side of life
/nAlways look on the right side of life
/nIf life seems jolly rotten, there's something you've forgotten
/nAnd that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing
/nWhen you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps
/nJust purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
/nSo, always look on the bright side of death
/nJust before you draw your terminal breath
/nLife's a counterfeit and when you look at it
/nLife's a laugh and death's the joke, it's true
/nYou see, it's all a show, keep them laughing as you go
/nJust remember the last laugh is on you
/nAlways look on the bright side of life
/nAnd always look on the right side of life
/nAlways look on the bright side of life
/nAnd always look on the right side of life
/n
