My latest highlight in python is, that you can easily change the way a text or word looks like. with for example s.capityl() all letters are capital!
Today (10/11/2023) my highlight was to understand loops, since they give you many options to include/exclude stuff with if functions
I finally understand Loops! Looping forward to solve problems with them :)
